This directory contains a NURBS tessellator for x3dom.

The tessellator is based on idea and example code from
A. J. Chung and A. J. Field
"A Simple Recursive Tessellator for Adaptive Surface Triangulation"
in Journal of Graphics Tools Vol. 5, Iss. 3, 2000,
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/emvise/).

The implementation spans four files:

o x3dom-nurbs-nodes.js - interface of the tessellator to x3dom
o x3dom-nurbs-pool.js - worker managament (current pool size is 3)
o x3dom-nurbs-worker.js - a worker
o x3dom-nurbs-tess.js - the tessellator

In order to use the tessellator just add the following to your XHTML
after inclusion of x3dom.js:
 <script type="text/javascript" src="x3dom-nurbs-pool.js"/>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="x3dom-nurbs-nodes.js"/>
.

As the tessellator is fully automatic, no further adjustments are needed.

For full documentation, see the main Ayam documentation.
